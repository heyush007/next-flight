Setup Database step by step guide. 

1. Download the sql script provided by the school. 
2. Download and install latest MariaDB into your system
3. Create database named : flight_sim
4. Import sql script provided by school by using this line in the command prompt.
 mysql -u root -p flight_sim < flight_simulator_database_script.sql
â€” if you can import it, navigate to the directory that consist the sql script file and then try it. 
- remember not to forget the password of the root, database. 
5. Once the import is done, check 
mysql -u root -p flight_sim
- and once you are connected, try writing 
Show tables; to check if the import were successfully done. 

NOW MOVING ON TO THE NEXT IMPORT. 
In order to import the new tables directly go through the following steps
1. Set the last foreign keys to 0 by
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
2. After that create tables as shown in the .sql file i.e. {setup_db.sql}
- Create weather table
CREATE TABLE Weather (
                         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                         `condition` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                         temperature DECIMAL(5, 2),
                         wind_speed DECIMAL(5, 2),
                         humidity INT,
                         visibility DECIMAL(5, 2)
);
- Create User table
CREATE TABLE User (
                      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                      username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                      fuel_consumed INT DEFAULT 500
);
- Create User_flight_log table
CREATE TABLE User_Flight_Log (
                                 id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                                 user_id INT,
                                 flight_id INT,
                                 weather_id INT,
                                 flight_time TIME,
                                 completion_status VARCHAR(50),
                                 created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                                 FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES User(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
                                 FOREIGN KEY (flight_id) REFERENCES Flight(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
                                 FOREIGN KEY (weather_id) REFERENCES Weather(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
ALTER TABLE Airport MODIFY id INT;  -- Or use the correct type (e.g., `UNSIGNED`)
ALTER TABLE Airport ENGINE=InnoDB;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Flight;
ALTER TABLE airport MODIFY id INT NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE airport DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
ALTER TABLE User MODIFY fuel_consumed INT DEFAULT 500;

- finally create table flight
CREATE TABLE Flight (
                        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                        departure_airport_id INT,
                        arrival_airport_id INT,
                        scheduled_departure_time DATETIME,
                        scheduled_arrival_time DATETIME,
                        FOREIGN KEY (departure_airport_id) REFERENCES Airport(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
                        FOREIGN KEY (arrival_airport_id) REFERENCES Airport(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

- now drop the not required tables 
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS goal_reached;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS goal;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS game;

- new updates in the alterations of column 
 ALTER TABLE User DROP FOREIGN KEY user_ibfk_1;
 ALTER TABLE User MODIFY COLUMN fuel_consumed INT;

- Add another table Checkpoint 

CREATE TABLE Checkpoint (
                            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                            user_flight_id INT,
                            weather_id INT,
                            checkpoint_time TIMESTAMP,
                            location_coordinates VARCHAR(255),
                            status VARCHAR(50),
                            FOREIGN KEY (user_flight_id) REFERENCES User_Flight_Log(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
                            FOREIGN KEY (weather_id) REFERENCES Weather(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

- Add another table achievements

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Achievements (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    achievement_name VARCHAR(255),
    achievement_description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES User(id)
);

- Added hurdles in the database as well for now.

-- Create index for faster level-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_hurdles_level ON Hurdles(level);

-- Add a view for hurdle statistics (optional but useful)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hurdle_stats AS
SELECT 
    level,
    COUNT(*) as hurdle_count,
    AVG(complexity) as avg_complexity,
    MIN(complexity) as min_complexity,
